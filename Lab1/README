This is a skeleton for CS 111 Lab 1.

Replace this README file with notes on your implementation.
Mentions any special features or limitations.

Limitations:
	Simple command length limited to 1024 characters as implementation relies on a buffer of that size. Exceeding limit causes a segfault.   

	The time travel feature depends on multithreading in execute thread. The Makefile has been updated to compile with the -pthread flag.
